My walkthough:

* my_first_test.spec.js is "Validate successful login", goes through the log in, clicks on the avatar on the botton left corner and compares names.

* my_second_test.spec.js is "Create a task in a task list in your project", this one gets into a little bit deeper, going through our project and creating a tasks in it.

* my_third_test.spec.js is "Create a milestone in your project", this one goes into our project and opens a pop up that allow us to create a milestone.

// I've ran the tests using the command npx playwright test \my_{number}_test.spec.js
